# UpSkill

UpSkill is a Landing Page created to promote and showcase educational services to its users.

The project was built on React.js, TypeScript and SASS, and also implemented other features to aid in its execution, such as custom hooks, state management and form validation.

To ensure the quality of the project, some best practices were adopted during its development, such as a live demo hosted on Vercel, mobile-first and responsive design, and test coverage with Lighthouse. In the code, approaches such as documentation, application of standardized code formatting and use of absolute imports were adopted.
